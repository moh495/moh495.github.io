Welcome to my personal webpage!

My name is Mohammed Nadjib Allah SALHI, I am a student in my first-year master control option instrumentation in faculty of hydrocarbons and chemistry [Ex-INH](https://fhc.univ-boumerdes.dz/), University of M'Hamed Bougara Boumerdes, previously known as the Algerian National Institute of Hydrocarbons. I have a bachelor's degree in control automation

During my former experiences in a varied set of companies, I had the privilege to work within both field and technology development centers. The latter broadened my perspective on the different set of challenges unique to each nature. Within the field hardships, I was inspired by the altruistic concern of specialists who dedicated supererogatory efforts to deliver the best solutions for their clients and in parallel demonstrated an in-depth mastery of both professional and interpersonal skill. Wherein development centers I discovered my passion for applied research and its potential contribution in the literal rise of our modern civilization. 

I'm currently looking for an entry level position in field operations or technology development. My main strengths revolve around the list presented below:
* Object Oriented Programming 
* Data analysis, visualization, and reporting. 
* Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning appliances.
* Signal and Image processing
* Modelisation and identification.
* Leadership, team collaboration, public speaking and effective communication.
* Good interpersonal skills, priority and crisis management.

Outside of my academic life, I find that volunteering, sports, and reading help me relax and I define myself as a lifelong learner above all else. If you are interested in collaborating on a project related to (AI, energy, oil and gas) or just want to have a productive discussion, feel free to contact me via my contacts.
